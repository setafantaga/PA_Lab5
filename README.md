# Compulsory 

    Create an object-oriented model of the problem. You should have at least the following classes: Catalog and two item classes at your choice. Consider using an interface or an abstract class in order to describe the items in a catalog.
    Implement the following methods representing commands that will manage the content of the catalog:
        add: adds a new entry into the catalog;
        list: prints the content of the catalog on the screen;
        play: playback using the native operating system application (see the Desktop class);
        save: saves the catalog to an external file (either as a text or binary, using object serialization);
        load: loads the catalog from an external file. 
    The application will signal invalid data (year, path, etc.) using a custom exception.
